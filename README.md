# Movie-Recommender-System
It is a machine-learning project based on NLTK, natural language processing, tokenization, etc. This project gives us 5 recommendations for each query on which movies one can watch and also search for the perfect movie for the user with 95% accuracy. Here I have used CSV files for data sets from where the data words will be extracted then the data is preprocessed as per requirements to extract the suitable words to compare the similarities between movies for giving the recommendations.
